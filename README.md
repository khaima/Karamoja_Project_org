Summary: Food Security & Crop Yield Analysis – Karamoja Region (2017)

Project Overview
Karamoja is one of the most food-insecure regions of Uganda. Low crop productivity—driven by drought, pests, and disease—contributes to chronic food shortages. NGOs and government agencies lack comprehensive visibility into crop performance and food security conditions. This analysis uses modeled satellite based yield estimates to identify vulnerable areas, quantify the yield gap between sorghum and maize, and provide actionable insights for targeted interventions.
Business Problem
Stakeholders (NGOs, government, agricultural cooperatives) need to:
•	Understand key drivers of yield variability and food insecurity.
•	Identify subcounties most at risk of food shortages.
•	Compare sorghum vs. maize performance to guide crop selection and resource allocation.
•	Quantify the relationship between population and food production.
•	Obtain evidence based insights to design effective interventions and monitor impact.
Without a data driven approach, decisions risk being inefficient, missing opportunities to improve food security.
